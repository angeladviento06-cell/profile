    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Angel—a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student with a passion for building digital spaces that feel both technically sound and artistically expressive. I specialize in modular networks and elegant web design, with a particular love for floral-themed layouts that bring warmth, personality, and authenticity to every project.

My work blends backend precision with frontend creativity. I configure VLANs, troubleshoot subnet issues, and optimize systems with clarity and persistence. But I also design interfaces that speak to the soul—layouts that are intuitive, responsive, and visually refined. Whether I’m coding a portfolio site or refining a user experience, I aim to harmonize structure and style in everything I build.

Each project I take on is a reflection of my belief: technology should not only function flawlessly, but also feel beautiful and personal. I’m here to create digital experiences that bloom with meaning.</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I've built and refined multiple portfolio sites, configured VLANs, and troubleshot complex subnet issues with persistence and clarity. My work blends technical structure with visual elegance. On the networking side, I’ve configured VLANs, resolved complex subnetting issues, and maintained system integrity with persistence and clarity. I approach every challenge with a structured mindset and a creative eye, ensuring that both the backend and frontend work in harmony.

Beyond the screen, I’ve also supported corporate operations as an assistant to a hiring manager, orchestrating smooth, behind-the-scenes logistics for meetings and interviews. This role sharpened my organizational skills and taught me the value of quiet leadership—ensuring everything runs beautifully, even when it’s invisible.</p>
